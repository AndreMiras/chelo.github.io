        <p>Hi Shopify team!, my name is Chelo and I would like to meet you.</p>
        <p>I'm a computer engineer living in Venezuela and I'm looking for new opportunities to work outside. In this search I find your 
        page, see your work, your videos, your concept and I like it. So, I think maybe we could meet and, why not?, work together.</p>

        <h3 class='subtitle'>My insterest on Shopify</h3>
        <p>You have the features that I'm looking for: </p>
        <ul class="circle_list">
            <li>Good enviroment where people can work but at same time have a fun time.</li>
            <li>A place where I can learn every day and grow as a programmer.</li>
            <li>Constant open source contribution. I have seen your repo and I like it, you offer useful tools for all the community and allows working with
            you product.</li>
            <li>Innovative Ideas. It's funny that some time ago, I thought that all the stores should have devices to let the customer create their list of products and pay them.
            When I saw this idea on your page, with the hardware and the support...I fell in love!, I would like to be part of this kind of ideas.</li>

        </ul>

    <div class="span6">
        <h3 class='subtitle'>How can I help?</h3>
        <p>I don't have a lot of experience but I really want to learn. Those are some of my features that could help:<p>
        <ul class="circle_list">
            <li>I know how to work with a team, even I prefer this than work alone, I know how to manage different personalities and get the better from each one.</li>
            <li>I don't like to work under stress but when something happens and it needs my attention urgently, I tend to be quiet and fairly concentrated.</li>
            <li>I always try to make a good code, I like that everyone can read and understand my code easily.</li>
            <li>I want to learn, so I usually search good books to learn new tools or even improve my knowledge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Gem for In-App Purchase</h4>
        <p>I would like to create a gem to work with In-App Purchase verifications for differents platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, etc).
        Recently I had to work adding this feature to a project and was difficult get the IAP for all the platforms. Finally we could do but was hard
        so I think maybe I can save time for others if I make a gem to do that.</p>

        <h4>Page to help stary animals</h4>
        <p>I love help animals, so I want create a new page or tool to promote the adoption of stray animals.
        I thought on a page where people can search the pet that they want based on features (big/small, cat/dog, short/long hair, etc) and the system
        returns all the animals, with these features, which are up for adoption.
        With this page I can help animals and create awareness among people about this problem.</p>
