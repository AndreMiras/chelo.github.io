        <h3>Good work environment</h3>
        <p>
        When I'm development a new feature, or solve a bug, or learning new tools, sometimes I feel very tired and with headache, the only thing that help me to get out of this problem
        is the environment on my work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I figured out that when I feel comfortable and happy I can work better, so I think this can strongly influence in the creativity and performance from developer.
        Thus, I'm willing to work for get that, I always try to have good relations with my fellows and  make feel at home the new people.

        <h3>Dance Salsa</h3>
        <p>
        Dancing is the best way I have to express myself, I can have a bad day and be very angry, but with just dance, one good song with a good partner I make my day.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you dance, you try to improve your skills to be better every day, you work to be more flexible, faster, to get more balance... 
        and at the same time, you are working with a partner or a team which it's sometimes difficult if you are working for a competitions, everyone is stressed and angry, so you should know how to manage with different personalities. 
        But after all of that, the final result is very satisfying.

        <h3>Crossfit</h3>
        <p>
        I have been doing Crossfit for six month, and I'm very impressed with my progress. Each month I improve my skills and my weights, it's feel good.
        </p>
        <p>
        Crossfit teach me the importance of team work, when a Wod (Work of the day) is very hard and difficult, you always have people
        encouraging you. Crossfit is the only sport where the last is the most cheered.
